v1.0.5.1
Bugfix - fixed a corner-case  where binary files dumped
after loading paired-end fastq (using --pe_list) were 
missing some nodes. Could manifest after loading 
binaries and trying to traverse the graph. 

Recommend users upgrade to this version.

Test results:
All unit tests pass, with valgrind also.
See latest_test_results for details.

Open issues:
